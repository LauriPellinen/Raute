Project for RAUTE 
---

## Overview

- Whole projects purpose was to make a web user interface for using and analysing machine learning methods.
- In the final product we used mostly javascript for the back-end and we had html template that we modified to our needs.
- I was mostly making the front-end code in this project but also partly partricipated in making of the back-emd code.
- We had also Database (MongoDB) implemented where we could log and store our users.

- We also used dockers container technology to containerize the whole project.

### Note

Not ALL code is self-made. We had group of 4 making the project. As earlier mentioned, I mostly participated in making of the code for front-end.
